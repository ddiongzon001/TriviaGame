## Snippets of Code

All the questions, which are stored in an array, were made into an object with multiple properties:
* Actual question
* Four choices stored in an array
* Correct answer
* Image for the result page
```javascript
var test = [{
        question: "Who hides eggs on a Sunday?",
        choices: ["Br'er Rabbit", "Bugs Bunny", "The Easter Bunny", "The White Rabbit"],
        answer: "The Easter Bunny",
        image: "../TriviaGame/assets/images/easter_bunny.jpg"
    },
    {
        question: "He's late for a very important date",
        choices: ["Lola Bunny", "Judy Hopps", "Thumper", "The White Rabbit"],
        answer: "The White Rabbit",
        image: "../TriviaGame/assets/images/white_rabbit.jpg"
    },
```
-----
To test if the user's guess was the correct answer, the website goes through multiple if/else if statements.

The user's choice which is stored in the an answer array, is compared to each choice in each question's object.

If the user's selection matches with the correct choice, it will display the right answer page, otherwise it will display the wrong answer page.

```javascript
if (test[questionCount].answer == test[questionCount].choices[0]) {
    console.log("went through 0");

    $("#answer0").on("click", rightAnswer);
    $("#answer1").on("click", wrongAnswer);
    $("#answer2").on("click", wrongAnswer);
    $("#answer3").on("click", wrongAnswer);


} else if (test[questionCount].answer == test[questionCount].choices[1]){
    console.log("went through 1");

    $("#answer0").on("click", wrongAnswer);
    $("#answer1").on("click", rightAnswer);
    $("#answer2").on("click", wrongAnswer);
    $("#answer3").on("click", wrongAnswer);
```
----
The user only has 10 seconds to answer each question. Everytime a question is displayed, the seconds variable is set to 10 and an interval is set in order to count down the number of seconds remaining.
```javascript
seconds = 10;
timeDisplay.text("Time remaining left: " + seconds + " seconds");
interval = setInterval(countDown, 1000) //remember to change this later!
answerDisplay.text("");
```
